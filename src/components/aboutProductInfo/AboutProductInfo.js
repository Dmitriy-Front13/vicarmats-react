            Deep cells collect and hold up to 50 OZ of dirt and liquid, preventing
            them from spreading through the car interior. To pour out the water, the mats need to be held almost
            vertically. This ensures that the water in the cabin will not splash, as can happen with rubber products.
            Our mats also reliably hold solid debris, sand or soil and do not allow them to move around the cabin.</p>
          <p className="about-product__text">
            Dirt collects at the bottom of the cells and does not get in the way under your feet. This is an indisputable advantage of GeoFloo products over rubber and velour analogues.
